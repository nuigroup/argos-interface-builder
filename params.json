{"name":"Argos-interface-builder","tagline":"An openFrameworks toolkit for developing multitouch musical interfaces.","body":"Argos is a drag-and-drop GUI interface builder built in openFrameworks, dealing specifically with creating musically-oriented interfaces for multi-touch interaction. Argos is a project initiated by Dimitri Diakopoulos, with help from NUI Groupâ€™s Seth Sandler, as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.\r\n\r\nThe initial code release includes ofxTouchAPI, a basic framework for creating multi-touch objects, and ofxArgosUI, an under-development UI toolkit consisting of a number of GUI controls with methods for both mouse and touch interaction. If you are interested in helping contribute, please get in touch! The development version of Argos will be released shortly on the SVN as a Visual Studio 2008 project.\r\n\r\n[Blog](http://www.dimitridiakopoulos.com/argos)\r\n\r\nShowcase:<br/>\r\n[![Vimeo](http://db.tt/0yw534lF)](http://vimeo.com/9175177)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](http://nuicode.com/projects/argos)\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2009 project\r\n<br/>\r\n[![GSoC 2009](http://db.tt/Uai2WuQE)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2009)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Dimitri Diakopoulos\t\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Seth Sandler\t","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
